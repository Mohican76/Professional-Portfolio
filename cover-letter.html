        <p><strong>Dear Hiring Manager,</strong></p>

        <p>I am excited to express my interest in joining your development team. As a hands-on web developer with a comprehensive technical background spanning aviation industry IT, computer networking, and modern web development, I bring a unique combination of problem-solving abilities and practical implementation skills.</p>

        <p>My development philosophy centers on "knowing a little bit of everything" – an approach that has served me well throughout my career. This diverse knowledge base, built through formal education at S.C.I.T. and ITT, enables me to approach challenges from multiple perspectives and create solutions that are both technically sound and user-friendly.</p>

        <p>I have developed and deployed <strong>seven complete applications</strong> that demonstrate my capabilities in modern web development, including three deployed on Netlify (Enhanced Counter App, Dice Roller, Lottery Bandit PWA) and four professional tools (Typing Speed Test, Finance Tracker, Recruiter Tracker, Train Tracker). Each project showcases my proficiency in React.js, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3, and Progressive Web App development.</p>

        <p>What sets me apart is my systematic approach to problem-solving, honed through years of technical work in diverse environments. I prefer software development over hardware work because it allows for more immediate creative results and fewer physical troubleshooting frustrations. My background in aviation industry contracting and computer networking has taught me the importance of reliability, attention to detail, and building systems that work correctly.</p>

        <p>I am particularly drawn to positions where I can contribute to building practical, user-focused applications while continuing to expand my technical expertise. My learning approach is hands-on and project-based – I learn best by building real applications that solve actual problems.</p>

        <p>I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills align with your needs. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team's success.</p>
